================

Additional codebase modules to complement WPILIBJ.

Always ensure proper coding etiquette, although I personally dislike the "m_" prefix that WPILIBJ uses because it is not proper Java etiquette. 

Keep in mind object-oriented design; each component or subsystem should be represented by an object and optionally implement the empty interface IDevice.

<!--Also, fuck threads. I am never working with that shit again. Concurrency errors and Java ME make it impossible to debug. Will look into java.lang.FutureTask for possibilities of asynchronous callbacks.-->

Can't believe there was command-based programming the whole time...
