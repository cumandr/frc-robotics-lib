================

Additional codebase modules to complement WPILIBJ.
Always ensure proper coding etiquette, although I personally dislike the "m_" prefix that WPILIBJ uses because it is not proper Java etiquette. 
Keep in mind object-oriented design; each component or subsystem should be represented by an object and optionally implement the empty interface IDevice.
